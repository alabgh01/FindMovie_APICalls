## Idea

Use open web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and fuse them together, that is use the result(s) of one API request to make another one. In this case, we use the result of API call to a movie info API to get a video from YouTube using a different API call.


## Project details

1. Use Bootstrap
2. Use JavaScript events and HTML input elements for interactivity
3. Use JavaScript asynchronous programming to retrieve data
4. Use JSON for data exchange
6. Use local storage or cookies

## To Run project
1. Install requirements.txt
2. Create your own API Keys on [omdb](http://www.omdbapi.com) and Youtube
3. Add your API keys to config.js file
